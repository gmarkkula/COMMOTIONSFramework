    "* Modified how `SCAgent.prepare_for_simulation()` sets the `conflict_point` attribute of `commotions.Simulation`. Previously this was calculated from the agent initial positions and goals, now I have hardcoded it to (0, 0) instead, with an assertion checking that the calculated value is very close to (0, 0) - as a verification that the SC scenario has been set up as expected. I did this because while setting up the HIKER scenarios I discovered that a `conflict_point` that got calculated to something very close to but not quite (0, 0) could put the pedestrian at a starting point just past its $D_s$ safety distance to the crossing, such that passing in second was no longer an option. Overall, the way I treat safety distances etc is a little brittle, so it would be nice to have some better solution in general, but for now this fixes this specific problem. This change might of course have an effect on previously run fits, especially the deterministic ones - especially the priority assertion / short-stopping ones? But I don't think so, given what they looked like? (If it didn't seem to the vehicle that the pedestrian could at all pass in second, then the probability of the pedestrian's pass-second behaviour should have been zero, etc?)\n",
    "* Modified `sc_scenario_helper.get_access_order_values()` such that any non-zero $T_\\mathrm{acc}$ get set to at least `sc_scenario_helper.ANTICIPATION_TIME_STEP`, because while testing the HIKER scenarios I was again seeing cases where a very large acceleration was anticipated by the pedestrian in order to pass before the car, but for a very brief $T_\\mathrm{acc}$, such that this didn't show up in the value calculation. Adding this requirement fixed this problem. Unfortunately, this model implementation imperfection seems to have underpinned some of the `oVAoBE*` models' capability of having pedestrians cross before full vehicle stop... Unclear to what extent."
