    "I have now:\n",
    "* Modified to disregard the first $\\Delta T$ time interval in `sc_fitting.metric_veh_av_surpl_dec()` as planned in the previous diary entry.\n",
    "* Fixed a bug in how I calculated the \"halfway to CS\" distance for the metrics `sc_fitting.py`; I had forgotten to add the collision distance to the half distance between conflict space border and initial position. This should especially affect the pedestrian scenarios and probably especially the `PedCrossVehYield` scenario (bigger effect the closer the initial position is to the conflict space border).\n",
    "* Introduced simulation stopping criteria for speeding up the fitting.\n",
    "* Introduced the concept of kinematic variations to scenarios in `sc_fitting.SCPaperScenario`, and added support for this in`sc_fitting.SCPaperParameterSearch`. In practice leveraging the underlying support in `parameter_search.ParameterSearch` for repeated tests of each parameterisation. So as things are implemented now, one can choose to either simulate across multiple scenario variants, or simulate with multiple repetitions per scenario, without any kinematic variants. Differently put, it is not possible to simulate multiple repetitions for each of multiple scenario variants.\n",
    "* Added kinematic variants to the previously defined one-agent scenarios, by perturbing the vehicle initial time to conflict space by $\\pm$0.5 s in all scenarios."
