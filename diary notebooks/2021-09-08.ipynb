    "* Adding optional assumption `oVAa`, for acceleration-aware affordance-based value estimates. The only effect it has is in `SCAgent.get_access_order_values_for_agent_v02()`, where it controls whether the call to `sc_scenario_helper.get_access_order_implications()` considers accelerations in the predicted state of the other agent.\n",
    "* As a sanity check, verifying that I get back some previous results:\n",
    "    * With `oVAa` and $T_\\mathrm{O} = 2$ s, $\\sigma_\\mathrm{O} = 0.001$ m, I get seemingly exactly the same results as in the 2021-09-01 simulations for the baseline kinematics, with base model and when turning on first `oBEo` and then instead `oBEv`.\n",
    "    * Without `oVAa`, and with $T_\\mathrm{O} = 0.5$ s, $\\sigma_\\mathrm{O} = 0.01$ m, I get seemingly exactly the same results as in the 2021-08-26  simulations with baseline kinematics, with base model + `oBEo`. (The last simulations of this type before I started adding the acceleration-aware stuff)."
