    "* Reworked the scenario formulation in a way that should work better both in general and especially for the upcoming probabilistic fits (studying one phenomenon at a time, rather than in some cases two phenomena per scenario) - see 2021-11-20b notes for details. As noted in 2021-11-20 notes, I am increasing the safety margins to 1 m and 1 s.\n",
    "* Rearranging in `sc_fitting.py` so instead of the class `SCPaperDeterministicOneSidedFitting` I now have a more generic class `SCPaperParameterSearch` which can take an arbitrary dict of scenarios, and the scenarios now also include a dict of metrics to compute for that scenario - so the whole thing is a bit more flexible.\n"
