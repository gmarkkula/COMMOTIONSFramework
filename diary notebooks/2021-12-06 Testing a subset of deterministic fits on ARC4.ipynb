    "\n",
    "I tested deterministic fitting of a subset of the models, as specified in this commit: https://github.com/gmarkkula/COMMOTIONSFramework/commit/49e3613ff4a0eaa209c9ddb87966b793b5348f92\n",

    "As can be seen in the `do_1.sh` SGE bath job file, this is using the `base` conda environment provided by ARC4. Added to todolist: Try specifying the exact python and package versions in a conda yml file.\n",

    "Below I am pasting the output from `do_2...` on the server, showing exactly the same results (in terms of the number of parameterisations meeting each criterion for each model) as in the 2021-12-05 diary notes. I am not saving the output .pkl files anywhere, just taking this as a confirmation that I am getting the same results from ARC4 as from my own computer.\n",
